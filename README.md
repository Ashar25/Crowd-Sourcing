# **Crowd Sourcing Framework**
### Application of machine learning-based postprocessing to improve crowd-sourced urban rainfall outlooks

The framework uses three different codes for data generation using (i) STORM V1 (Storm_run.py), converting rainfall to categorical data 
(ii) Data Generation.ipynb, and scenario generation model fitting (iii) Scenarios and Model fitting.ipynb

The data used in the codes are available in the "Data" folder.
